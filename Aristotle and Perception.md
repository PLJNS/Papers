Aristotle and Perception <small>by Paul Jones</small>
=====================================================

Centuries before Descartes’s pointing out of the mind-body problem, one
of the founders of Western thought elucidated a systematic and
methodical account of perception and how it comes about. Aristotle’s
program of perception remains a robust and intuitive theory, yet the
precise details of the most important parts of the theory are hotly
debated within academia. *De Anima* II 5 and 12 contain the most direct
addressing of issues of perception and sensation in the Aristotelian
corpus. Chapter 5 discusses sensation and the faculty of perception in
general. Chapter 12 again takes up perception generally, but in the
context of his form and matter. The approach and methodology that
Aristotle takes on to assure objectivity on the matter is scientific in
nature. Richard Sorabji, M.F. Burnyeat, and Victor Caston are renowned
Aristotle scholars who have offer competing interpretations of the most
difficult portions of *De Anima*. Sorabji holds that perception is a
wholly physiological process. This may seem extreme, and yet, there are
those that hold the radically opposite view supported by the same text.
For instance, Burnyeat holds the view that perception causes no
physiological or physical changes at all. Caston, on the other hand, is
open to the possibility of some reconciliation between the purely
physiological and entirely cognitive views. There are two facets of the
question that are also competing: (1) What did Aristotle actually think
about perception? and (2) What is actually the fact of the matter about
perception? Through careful and balanced reading of the both the source
text and the surrounding literature, it is clear that while Aristotle
was ambiguous on some important details, his program still offers great
insight and foundation into the investigation of perception.

There are definitions that Aristotle uses throughout his account of how
perception comes about. Aristotle observes that every sense has an
**organ** (skin, ears), a **medium** (air, food), **proper objects**
(textures for touch, sounds for hearing). Then, perception involves a
**causal process** of the object through the medium to the sense organ,
and then to the thinking organ. This sounds like a physiological
process, but what Aristotle goes on to assert imbues doubt in this.

Aristotle notes that a perceiver is affected by an object that *is not
part* of the perceiver. There are two ways in which the perceiver can be
altered: (1) When the perceiver becomes like the object perceived,
“becomes an other”, in the replacement of one quality by another, for
the skin to heat up; and (2) When the perceiver comes to have some new
quality, like coming to have redness, “the reception of form without
matter.” Already, we have come across the controversial issue in
Aristotle’s philosophy of mind. Does the reception of form without
matter cause a physiological change? In order to solve where our mind
comes to have or know of perceptions, Aristotle uses a distinction
between levels of potentiality and actuality.

Aristotle’s system of potentiality and actuality with regard to
perceivers is as follows, there are: (a) perceivers who have the power
to see, hear, or otherwise perceive, though they happen to not be
exercising the sense; and (b) perceivers who are actually seeing or
hearing. Aristotle holds that language necessitates that we use words
like “alteration” to describe the movement between these two states.
Aristotle concludes II 5 with a refined version of his original claim
about perception, using more precise language with regards to the
non-physiological transition from (a) to (b):

> The perceiver is potentially what the perceptible object actually is
> already, as we have said. When it is being affected, then, it is
> unlike the object; but when it has been affected it has been made like
> the object and has acquired its quality.

Richard Sorabji outlines the most simple of the three interpretations in
his work ‘Aristotle’s Theory of Sense Perception.’ His **literalist**
interpretation is hinged on three phrases from Aristotle. Sorabji points
out that according to Aristotle, a sense organ:

1.  becomes like the thing perceived,

2.  is potentially such as the thing perceived already, and

3.  receives the form of the thing perceived without matter.

His claim is that ordinary alteration is all that Aristotle requires for
perception. Sense organs literally take on the perceptible qualities of
objects outside perceivers received from form without matter. More
precisely,

> If a subject $S$ comes to perceive a perceptible quality $F$ at time
> $t$, then $S$ literally takes on the quality of $F$ in the relevant
> organ at $t$.

Sorabji goes through *De Anima* and finds very convincing source text to
suggest that what Aristotle meant when he was talking about a real
transition or alteration. His strongest argument points to *De Anima*
$423^b27-424^b18$. There is a problem for touch that does not exist for
any other sense. The eye-jelly is colorless and the inside of one’s ear
is silent, but for touch, skin is not free from the physical qualities
it perceives (like hot and cold, dry and wet, rough and smooth). When
skin touches the heat that it is already, it will not be able to
perceive it because it cannot be made to acquire something it already
is. Sorabji thinks that the competing interpretations cannot handle this
fact because sending coded messages does not allow for this limitation.
He goes so far as to say his entire case could rest on this problem. He
offers one more argument on Aristotle’s treatment of plants. They
obviously do not perceive hot and cold, yet they are warmed and cooled,
that is, affected. The sense of touch needs a mid-point to be able to
receive characteristics of earth, the predominant element in plants, but
of all other tangible qualities. Because plants are already cold and
dry, as earth, and “receive” refers to the usual perceptual process,
Sorabji sees further confirmation of his claim.

M.F. Burnyeat in his simply titled work ’*De Anima* II 5’ offers a close
scrutiny of its namesake. Burnyeat wants to argue for an Intentionalist
reading, which holds that the crucial part of Aristotle’s perceptual
program is not handeled by the literal taking-on of qualities by
sense-*organs*, but that the *sense* becomes aware of the perceptible
quality. His argument rests on Aristotle’s hierarchy potentiality and
actuality, and where perception fits into it. There are three levels:

1.  An **ordinary potentiality** is when a thing can take on a type of
    quality, and its respective **first actuality** is when it takes on
    of the possibilities.

2.  The **first potentiality** is when something is capable of
    exercising dispositions perfect to its nature, and its respective
    **second actuality** is when those are developed.

3.  The **second potentiality** is when a thing retains the developed
    actuality, remaining capable of exercising it, becoming the **third
    actuality** when exercised again.

Notice that first potentiality is parallel to second actuality, and
second potentiality is parallel to third actuality. These distinctions
are used in the following passage:

> In the first and second case we pass from potentially to actually
> knowing; but in the first case we do so by being altered through
> learning, and by frequent changes from the contrary state, while in
> the second case — where we pass from having ... knowledge without
> actualizing it, to actualizing it — we do so in another way
> $(417^a30)$.

Burnyeat takes seriously the precise translation that perception is an
“alteration of a sort.” He points out passages that state when a worker
exercises his knowledge to build, that worker is not undergoing any
change when he does so. This is moving from a second potentiality to a
third actuality, which, according to Aristotle, is not an alteration in
the same way. This is the same “alteration of a sort” as when a subject
$S$ comes to perceive some perceptible quality with their previously
developed sense. In the case of perceiving the color red, this movement
is referred to with the jargon “appeared to redly,” which means to bring
about an awareness of red without actually *being* red.

Victor Caston, in his work ‘The Spirit and the Letter: Aristotle on
Perception’, wrecks havoc on both of the previously elucidated theories
about Aristotle’s perceptual program. To begin with, he outlines the
landscape of interpretations of Aristotle’s perceptual account. In doing
so, he commits Sorabji and Burnyeat to his own formulations based on the
text. Beginning with the literalisms, he defines Primitive Literalism,
Fundamentalism, and Latitudinarian. Moving to Spiritualisms, he defines
High Church Spiritualism and New Age Spiritualism. He proceeds to
enumerate specific and strong arguments against both positions.

Caston’s original contribution is what he calls his **analogical
reading**, which is:

> If a subject $S$ comes to perceive a perceptible quality $F$ at time
> $t$, then $S$ undergoes some physiological change in the relevant
> organ at $t$ such that it becomes like $F$, even if it does not become
> true to say that the organ is $F$ in just the same sense that the
> perceptible object is $F$.

This interpretation relies on being able to reduce matter outside of the
perceiver into information, which is then decoded or interpreted in a
physiological way. This makes the brain take on a **limited likeness**
to the matter outside the brain, through **transduction**:

> If some $x$ receives $F$ without the matter from some $y$, then for
> some relevantly related $G$ (where $G \neq F$),
>
> 1.  $x$ receives $G$ with the matter from $y$ and so becomes a replica
>     of $G$
>
> 2.  $x$ receives $F$ by receiving $G$ with the matter.
>

From his large survey of positions and arguments for and against them,
Caston claims that there is an alternative to the two seemingly
diametrically opposed theories. He makes it clear that Aristotle is
committed to at least some physiological change in perception, just not
necessarily and replica. He convincingly argues that the quality that is
important to Aristotle for the transmission of information between form
and matter are proportions.

This paper started with a general review of a neutral reading of *De
Anima* II 5 and 12 and the perceptual program those chapters contain,
specifically interested in how perception comes about. Moving to
Sorabji’s Literalist reading, it is clear that this is the
commonsensical, simple approach. Quickly moving the Burnyeat’s
Spiritualist reading, the reader learned why Literalism is untenable
considering actuality and potentiality. Concluding with an overview of
Caston’s new analogical reading, the reader was made aware of serious
shortcomings in both major readings, and the possibility of an
amalgamation of the two. Because of his strong denial of both extremes
of the debate, Caston emerges as the most acceptable theory of what
Aristotle had in mind for perception, despite Sorabji’s straight forward
approach and Burnyeat’s strict adherence to the text.
