Thesis
------

The purpose of this paper is to resolve the issues raised by Ginet in
his “Reply to Klein” in Chapter 5 of “Is Infinitism the Solution to the
Regress Problem?” and raise other, still: unanswered questions that
infinitism raises. First, I will outline the argument for infinitism
presented by Klein in his “Infinitism is the Solution to the Regress
Problem.” Then, I will outline the problems raised by Ginet in what was
the “last word” of the exchange, which is his “Reply to Klein.” Then, I
will argue that his reply is not successful in its goals. Finally, I
will offer problems for infinitism that take account of what went wrong
in Ginet’s reply.

The Argument for Infinitism
---------------------------

Klein has two ways of arguing for infinitism. In the logical space of
the structure of justification, there exists only three possible
components. Justification ends, continues forever, or loops back in over
itself. If Klein can show that it is inconsistent to hold that
justification ends or loops back in on itself, then we have reason for
investigating and accepting infinitism. This is his first strategy.

### The Argument Against the Opposition

Klein argues that neither foundationalism nor coherentism, the former
necesserilly warrant-transfer and the later either warrant-transfer or
warrant-emergent, can solve the regress problem. He does this by means
of a conversation between two agents, representing the viewpoints of a
foundationalist, coherentist, and a doubter.

To represent the doubter, Klein uses the name Doris. In the conversation
regarding foundationalism, the other participant’s name is Fred. In his
charitable way, Klein grants that foundationalism is true and seeks to
find the what foundationalism entails. Fred asserts that $p$. Doris asks
Fred for his reason for believing $p$, to which Fred responds $r_1$. The
next natural question that Doris poses is what are Fred’s reasons for
$r_1$? The reponse is $r_2$, and this back and forth goes on for some
time. Finally, Fred comes to $b$, which is a foundational belief. Fred
asserts that it is no longer appropriate to ask of $b$ the question
asked of $r_1 \dots r_n$ [^1]. Doris’s next question is much different,
asking of Fred, “I grant that $b$ has autonomous warrant. But what I
want to know is whether autonomously warranted propositions are, in
virtue of that fact, somewhat likely to be true.”

There are only three possible doxastic attitude with regards to a
proposition: assent, dissent, or withold judgement. Fred has these three
options with regards to Doris’s question about the relationship between
autonomous warrant and truth. Fred’s options:

> 1.  He can hold that autonomously warranted propositions are somewhat
>     likely to be true in virtue of the fact that they are autonomously
>     warranted.
>
> 2.  He can deny that autonomously warranted propositions are somewhat
>     likely to be true in virtue of the fact that they are autonomously
>     warranted.
>
> 3.  He can withhold whether autonomously warranted propositions are
>     somewhat likely to be true in virtue of the fact that they are
>     autonomously warranted.
>
The problem is now clear: Fred has a trilemma where none of options are
tenable. If Fred assents to the that autonomously warranted propositions
are likely to be true in light of there being autonomously warranted,
then, Klein argues, “*the regress has continued.*” Fred now has to
produce his reasons for thinking that any proposition, in this case $b$,
with the property of autonomous warrant, $F$, is likely to be true, and
this continues *ad infinitum*. If Fred sees this and either dissents or
witholds judgment, then his belief set and their justification
relationships are somehow “not likely to be true.” This would solve the
regress but transfer no warrant.

Klein crafts a similar argument for coherentism, where instead of Fred
the foundationalist, there is Carl the coherentist. Carl faces a
trilemma just like Fred’s, where Doris questions Carl about

### The Argument In Favor of the View

Ginet’s “Reply to Klein”
------------------------

Reply to Ginet …Again
---------------------

Infinitism is Not the Solution to the Regress Problem …Again
------------------------------------------------------------

This work will raise two criticisms of infinitism. The first criticism
will employ distinctions and terms defined below. The second criticism
will mirror Klein’s conversation-style argument against foundationalism.
The distinctions are between trivial and nontrivial truth, interesting
and uninteresting arguments, and limited and unlimited epistemic agents.
Additionally, the argument will use an inoffesive principle that Klein
himself espouses.

### Definitions

Nontrivial truth is the variety of truth which philosophers and
non-philosophers typically seek. An example of a nontrivial truth claim
would be “All $x$s are $y$s” where X and Y are substituted for nouns
which cannot be themselves. To instantiate such a claim, “All Fords are
good cars.” This claim is nontrivial because the concept of “Ford” does
not fully contain the concept of “good car” and vice versa. Ford Motors
also manufacture clothes, engines, replacement parts, …Furthermore, the
sentence contains “good”, which adds some normative, subjective
evaluation of the cars. This adds to the fact that the claim is
non-trivial, in that the analysand and analysis are not equivalent,
which is all that is necessary and sufficient for non-triviality in this
sense, and there are additional non-necessary true claims within it.
Contrast this with trivial truth, which comes in a number of varieties
as well. If the analysis of some concept contains the analysand, i.e.
the analysis is self-referential, then you have a trivial truth. For
example, the claim that “All $x$s are $x$s” is trivial for all X. To
instantiate such a claim, “All good cars are good cars.” Another quality
of trivial truth is vacuousness, exemplified by tautological claims
like, “All Ford cars in 469 BC were kept in the Parthenon.” This claim
is trivial because the set of cars before the Christian Era is the empty
set, so claims about them will be necessarily true and not descriptive
of any theoretical or actual objects. A quality shared by all the
trivial truths, vacuous or otherwise, is that to understand the concepts
in a trivial truth is to gain no knowledge from the claim.

Interesting arguments are ones which philosophers and non-philosophers
typically seek. A constitutive part of interesting propositions are
interesting arguments are nontrivial truths. But before semantics,
interesting arguments have syntactical properties. An example of such an
interesting argument would be *modus ponens* in its classical
formulation:

<span>c@l@</span> & $p$\
 & $p \to q$\
 $\therefore$ & $q$\

What makes *modus ponens* interesting in the relevant way is that there
are no repeated terms, the argument is irreducible, and the conclusion
is dinstinct from the the premise. It is possible to add another clause
to the argument and not cause the argument to be invalid or change the
conclusion. Uninteresting arguments, on the other hand, have repeated,
inessential syntatic components. For instance, consider the argument:

<span>c@l@</span> & $p$\
 & $p \to q$\
& $\lnot q \to \lnot p$\
 $\therefore$ & $q$\

This modification does not change the validity of the argument, it is
still truth preserving. But what makes it uninteresting is that the
third clause adds nothing to the argument, it does not allow a reasoner
to conclude anything new or play a necessary role in coming to the
exisiting conclusion.

There are also semantic conditions on what makes for an interesting
argument. Like in syntax, there interesting arguments contain no
repeated or redundant propositions. For instance, consider the argument:

<span>c@l@</span> & All animals are mortal.\
& All men are mortal.\
& Socrates is an animal and a man.\
 $\therefore$ & Socrates is mortal\

What makes this argument uninteresting is that it has an inessential and
still unproblematic element. Any reasoner can come to the same
conclusion without either the clause regarding the mortality of animals
or men. Another semantic condition that interesting arguments have is of
not containing any trivial truths, in the sense described above. The
reason that they cannot contain trivial truths is because trivial truths
will never yield a conclusion distinct from themselves. Of course all
sorts of propositions are implied by “All Ford cars in 469 BC were kept
in the Parthenon.” But these conclusions are not unique in the right way
to this claim. Whatever can can be concluded from this claim will be
trivial, and will be able to be concluded from other trivial truths.

There are a number of ways that an epistemic agent can be limited and
unlimited, and some of those ways are not mutually exclusive in the
abstract. For instance, an epistemic agent can be limited or unlimited
with regards to doxastic attitudes. It is possible for God[^2] to
entertain all propositions at once, while human beings are limited to
only a few propositions at any given time.

Human beings are limited epistemic agents. This argument is not a rehash
or rebranding of the finite mind objection to infinitism. There are a
number of ways that an epistemic agent agent can be limited. For
instance, an epistemic agent can be limited with regards to the number
of propositions that can be doxastic at any given time, which is what
the finite mind objection to infinitism is hinged on. But in another
way, an epistemic agent can be limited in the complexity of a compound
of propositions. For instance, consider the statement,

$$\lnot p \land (q \land u \lor v) \to \lnot \lnot r \lor t \land w$$

It is possible for most sufficiently developed human epistemic agents to
accept an argument of this form, with proper inputs. But it may be
difficult to show a less sophisticated epistemic agent, like say a
pre-teen, that with proper inputs this argument warrants assent. This is
how an epistemic agent can be limited in regard to complexity of
compound propositions. Imagine a complex argument with hundreds of
propositions, where both the syntax and semantics are sound and valid.
Such an argument, if understood, warrants assent. But there will be a
limit of human capacity in this regard, both by nature of available
memory and time to assent to each proposition. Thus, there are at least
two ways in which epistemic agents can be limited, one of which is the
same way as agents are limited in the finite mind objection, the other a
limit on the complexity of possible assent.

This work has now outlined enough distinctions to present the first
objection, or more accurately a limit, on infinitism. Infinitism will be
contigent on the nature of the physical world with regard to interesting
arguments. If the physical world is infinitely divisible or infinitely
large, then there exists an infinite numbers of propositions which can
be believed, and thus an infinite number of interesting arguments which
can be crafted. On the other hand, if the physical world is not at least
inifinitely divisible or infinitely large, then there does not exist an
unlimited number of propositions, and thus an infinite number of
interesting arguments cannot be crafted.

This is significant because philosophical investigation seeks necessary
truth and epistemological investigation seeks the necessary and
sufficient conditions for knowledge. If it is not the case that there
are an infinite number of interesting arguments, then infinitism may be
true for only uninteresting arguements. While the infinitist may not
mind accepting that the theory requires including convoluted
propositions, it should be taken as a vice. It is a vice of any theory
to require accepting implausible but technically true models.

Weak as this limit is, infinitists can accept the argument and fight
back by pointing out there are an infinite number of interesting
propositions regardless of the size or divisibility of the physical
world. For instance, there are infinite number of reasons to accept that
“$2 + 3 = 5$.” Namely, that two plus three is not any other number but
three, and there are infinite numbers. One can construct cases like this
for clocks and other counting instances. Interestingly enough, the
response can utilize any of the distinctions above to discount these
cases. It is trivially true that there infinite number of reasons that
“$2 + 3 = 5$”. Ginet notes this in his first response to Klein, and his
reponse is sufficient for discounting this particular rebuttle. Any
generous theorist will also grant that these sorts of chains of infinite
reasons belong in the set of uninteresting arguments, as the only
essential evidence for the belief that “2 + 3 = 5” is itself. Finally,
it is possible to argue back on grounds of human limits, but this would
suffer from the finite mind re-response, and so the reader should rely
on the first two rebuttles given.

Before the final new argument against infinitism is given, the term
“functional equivilence” needs to be defined. Functional equivilence in
the sense used in this work is a property of two theories which make all
of the same perscriptions. For instance, every theory is functional
equivilent to itself, where Newton’s theory of gravitation makes all the
same predictions as Newton’s theory of gravitation. However, Newton’s
theory of gravitation is not functionaly equivilent to Einstein’s theory
of relativity; the two theories conflict where the space-time continuum
bends[^3].

Finally, an important virtue of the correct theory of knowledge is that
it can be used by epistemic agents to evalutate themselves. Of course it
is not necessary to have second order knowledge, though perhaps it is
possible, but the theory should be actionable. If a theory makes no
predictions or attributions, or makes only ones which are the same ones
as a inconsistent theory, then it is a bad theory. Klein himself
expresses this,

> I will be arguing that neither account of warrant can provide it
> solution to the regress problem because neither account can be
> employed by it self-conscious practitioner to increase the rational
> credibility of a questioned proposition and, thus, it primary reason
> for adopting either foundationalism or coherentism has been
> eliminated.

This work will make use of this principle, under the following
formulation, entitled “(U)sed by a (S)elf-concious (P)racticioner
principle:”

> <span>**(USP) **</span> An account of the theory of knowledge should
> be able to be used by a self-concious practicioner to increase the
> credibility of propoisitions in a way that is unique from
> contradicting theories.

### The Technically True Objection

Infinitism is trivially true because it is contigent on there being
unlimited epistemic agents and for counting uninteresting arguments as
part of the set of possible beliefs. It is trivially true in the sense
that it is equivilent to claiming of mathematics that “There are an
infinite amount of numbers.” Of course this will need more motivating,
but here is a *prima facie* reason for thinking so. Part of the
infinitist thesis is that there are an infinite amount of potentially
justifiers for any belief, roughly that “There are an infinite amount of
propositions/justifiers.” Just as to understand numbers is to understand
that there are infinitely many, the understand propositions is to
understand that there are infinitely many. The concepts in the both
claims renders unto the reader no cognitive value, because to understand
numbers or propositions is to understand that there are an infinite
amount of them. The reason that to understand propositions is to
understand that there infinitely many of them is because propositions
can be represented symbolically, with variables like $p$, $q$, etc.
These variables can take on information about numbers, in fact
propositional logic is the fruit of mathematics, and so *of course*
there are infinitely many. In this way, to reason from this infinitist
thesis seems *prima facie* to contain a hidden tautology.

Ignoring the issue of contigency on size and divisibility of the
physical world for there existing infinite interesting arguments,
infinitism will still rely on uninteresting arguments for its truth, and
this should be seen as a vice. Philosophy is interested in necessary
truth, and one conception of this is truth in all possible worlds.
Consider the world with only one proposition, say $A$. Let $\times$
represent any standard logical operator in
$\lbrace \lor, \land, \to \rbrace$. With this, the thesis of infinitism
is correct, one can construct infitite propositions with,
$A \times A \times \ldots \times A$. If this world were to have an
epistemic agent capable of believing $A$, the three accounts of the
structure of justification have different stories about this agent’s
state. The foundationalist is forced to say that because $A$ is the only
proposition, it must be the foundational belief. The coherentist is
forced to say that $A$ is justified by $A$, at least on the warrant
transfer view. Why is it a virtue of infinitism that it can respond that
$A$ is justified by the propositional belief that $A\to A$? Which is
then justified by $A \land A \to A$, ad infinitum. This answer is no
better with regards to arbitrariness than the vicious circular reasoning
of warrant transfer coherentism. Foundationalism seems to have the best
way of explaining this possible world, though it needs to explain what
properties foundational beliefs need to have (otherwise the agent could
never come to actually believe the proposition).

In fact, this base case of a possible world is a problem for all
solutions to the regress, especially in light of Klein’s Fred and Doris
argument. In the possible world where there is only one proposition and
an epistemic agent which can believe it, none of the theories can give a
non-arbitrary or non-regressive story about the belief. The coherentist
relies on circular reasoning. The infinitist relies on circular
reasoning with uninteresting arguments. The foundationalist will make a
claim about $A$ necessarily have the foundational property $F$ if $S$
can come to believe it. As Klein pointed out, if this epistemic agent
questions themselves about the believed proposition, say foundationalism
is also a beliveable proposition in this world, then the regress
continues. This argument for skepticism is not the principle thrust of
this work, but notice that it includes a demonstration of how infinitism
cannot be true.

For all those worlds with limited epistemic agents, like our own,
infinitism is going to be functionally equivilent to justification
emergent coherentism. Imagine some limited epistemic agent who is
listing her epistemic commitments, or perhaps having them ascribed to
her. This agent is going to be limited in some regard, either in the
complexity of the structure of justification she can conceive or in the
time she has to iterate over her belief set. Therefore, she is going to
have to stop at some point, wherever her limit is met. It is
*impossible* for her to go any further with regards to the structure of
her possible justificational states. In this way, she is in a state in
accordance with warrant emergent coherence. Infinitism now inherits the
problems with this view, as it can be functionally equivilent to it for
limited agents, which are the one’s we typically consider in
epistemology.

Now notice that infinitism has violated (USP). When infinitism is
practiced by a self-concious and limited agent with regards to
interesting arguments, the predictions and attributions of the theory
about the structure of justification are functionally identical to those
predictions and attributions from warrant-emergent coherentism. Klein
shows that this view could not solve the regress problem even if it were
true. If a self-concious agents practices infinitism, then his view
might as well be coherentism.

Thus, infinitism is trivially true contigent on allowing uninteresting
arguments into the domain of possible belief states and only for
unlimited epistemic agents.

### Non-Arbitrariness and Belief Sets

With regards to the regress, it moves the question of a
non-arbitrariness from beliefs themselves to belief sets.

For all limited agents, infinitism will obtain as practically identical
to foundationalism from the perspective of agents, and yet Klein thinks
it’s important that an agent be able to practice in giving or having
reasons. If he doesn’t, his Fred/Doris objection must be taken as
invalid. If he does, then we can accept either infinitism or emergent
coherentism with all the same results. Because infinitism has problems
with triviality and contingency, we should adopt the functionally
identical emergent coherent view to avoid this baggage.

But this view doesn’t solve the regress problem on Klein’s own view.

Conclusion
----------

[^1]: Later, when Doris asks how autonomously warranted propositions are
    somewhat likely to be true, that “Fred went meta first.” This
    statement of Fred’s must be what he was referring to. The
    foundationalist has room to respond by claiming that foundational
    beliefs are simple concepts and latent biases, dispositions,
    attitudes rather than this rigid belief Klein is attributing.
    Furthermore, the foundationalist can say that the confusion is
    arising out of the difference between knowing and be able to assert,
    or akin.

[^2]: Please put aside the issue of such a being’s existence or
    nonexistence, the work only uses the qualities which gods have.
    Imagine a world with an omniscient and omnipotent being.

[^3]: Perhaps this is not *quite* right or not subtle enough of an
    understanding, but please accept this on its face as I will not use
    physics in my argument.
