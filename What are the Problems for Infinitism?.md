What are the Problems for Infinitism?
=====================================

Thesis
------

The purpose of this paper is to resolve the issues raised by Ginet in
his “Reply to Klein” in Chapter 5 of “Is Infinitism the Solution to the
Regress Problem?” and raise other, still: unanswered questions that
infinitism raises. First, I will outline the argument for infinitism
presented by Klein in his “Infinitism is the Solution to the Regress
Problem.” Then, I will outline the problems raised by Ginet in what was
the “last word” of the exchange, which is his “Reply to Klein.” Then, I
will argue that his reply is not successful in its goals. Finally, I
will offer problems for infinitism that take account of what went wrong
in Ginet’s reply.

The Argument for Infinitism

### The Argument Against the Opposition

### The Argument In Favor of the View

Ginet’s “Reply to Klein”

Reply to Ginet …Again

Infinitism is Not the Solution to the Regress Problem …Again
------------------------------------------------------------

Trivially true for worlds with propositions and theoretically agents.

Either contingently true or uninterestingly true for worlds that are
finite with agents limited in inoffensive ways.

With regards to the regress, it moves the question of a
non-arbitrariness from beliefs themselves to belief sets.

For all limited agents, infinitism will obtain as practically identical
to foundationalism from the perspective of agents, and yet Klein thinks
it’s important that an agent be able to practice in giving or having
reasons. If he doesn’t, his Fred/Dora objection must be taken as
invalid. If he does, then we can accept either infinitism or emergent
coherentism with all the same results. Because infinitism has problems
with triviality and contingency, we should adopt the functionally
identical emergent coherent view to avoid this baggage.

But this view doesn’t solve the regress problem on Klein’s own view.
